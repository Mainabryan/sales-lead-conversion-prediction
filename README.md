# Sales Lead Conversion Prediction

🎯 **Goal**: Predict whether a sales lead will convert into a paying customer using lead data such as industry, budget, location, and interaction history.

## 📊 Problem Statement
Businesses generate numerous leads from marketing campaigns, but only a portion convert into paying customers. This project uses machine learning to predict which leads are most likely to convert, helping sales teams prioritize high-potential leads and optimize efforts.

## 🔍 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains features such as:
- Lead source
- Monthly budget
- Industry
- Employee count
- Interaction score
- Customer lifetime value
- Converted (target label)

## 🧠 Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature encoding
- Model training using Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and feature importance

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📈 Results
The model achieved an accuracy of **XX%**, with top predictive features being:
- Interaction score
- Lead source
- Monthly budget

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Focus sales efforts on leads with high interaction scores and budgets.
- Improve engagement strategies for low-performing lead sources.
